# RPG Game 
1. This game is built using GDScript on Godot Game Engine.
2. This is a prototype of an upcoming game that would be on a much bigger scale that I am working on right now.
3. This prototype allows players to move, attack enemies and get hit by enemies.
4. This prototype also experiments with camera limits and sound effects.
5. This prototype was necessary for me to test out a suitable game engine to develop my dream projects.
